				<h5>Work_</h5>

				<h2>Since January of 2015, I have immersed myself in a multitude of programming languages and tools, starting with JavaScript and JQuery, to Ruby and Rails, and finally to Python and Django.</h2>

				<h4>As a kid, I taught myself HTML and CSS to build simple, fun websites in my freetime. As an adult, my passion has grown to become my career. I attended Epicodus, a coding bootcamp that has laid the groundwork for my programming experience. There, I learned Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and a number of other useful tools and concepts. From there, to my internship at a local software consultancy, I began my relationship with Python and Shopify, and obtained real experience being a part of a team and contributing to live projects. You can find examples of my work on my github <a href="#">here</a></h4>
